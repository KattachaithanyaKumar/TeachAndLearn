Who we are
At Teach and Learn, we are committed to delivering tailored and all-encompassing services that foster personal growth and development, empowering individuals to surmount obstacles and attain their maximum potential. Our unwavering dedication to providing top-notch support and guidance is at the forefront of everything we do.

What is SRP
The School Readiness Program is a customized intervention program designed to aid children with distinctive learning and behavioral challenges in transitioning into mainstream schooling. To optimize each child’s potential, we have a team of highly motivated and qualified educators, speech therapists, and occupational therapists who conduct group sessions as part of our comprehensive program.



Who is it For
The School Readiness Program (SRP) is specially designed to cater to children who require additional support to develop their group readiness skills, engage in early academics, enhance their social skills, improve their fine motor skills, and further develop their language and communication skills. Our highly qualified teachers, speech therapists, and occupational therapists conduct group sessions as part of our program to ensure the comprehensive development of each child. The SRP curriculum integrates development opportunities into all aspects to optimize progress towards achieving their full potential.

How are we Different
Our SRP features a personalized and dynamic multidisciplinary approach with low student-to-teacher ratios and integrated speech therapy. We boast a highly trained staff and on-site access to a range of specialists, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, psychological and educational therapists, and specialist teachers.



How do we Do it
As an integral component of our individualized and multidisciplinary approach, a customized individual educational plan (IEP) will be devised for each child in collaboration with our team of specialist teachers, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists. This personalized plan is designed to harness and address each child’s unique strengths and challenges, thereby facilitating their goal attainment.

What would be next for your child
The primary objective of the SRP is to provide students with the requisite skills to successfully participate in mainstream educational settings. Our program is adaptable and flexible, and focuses on promoting a seamless transition to mainstream education. We offer both full-time and part-time programs, and encourage progressive students to attend both the mainstream setting and EIP when they are deemed prepared.
